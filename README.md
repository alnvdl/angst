# Angst

A simple school score calculator/simulator with a custom DSL.

This was developed when I was in university and wanted a way to simulate final
course scores based on the weights laid out by each professor at the beginning
of the semester.

The most interesting part is the compiler for the high-level score formula
language, built in JavaScript. This was done when I was learning about
compilers; it's certainly a case of over-engineering :-)

There's a live preview: https://alnvdl.github.io/Angst/

It's outdated, but someone may take interest on extending it to support more
complex formulas and improve the usability.
