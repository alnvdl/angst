Angst
=====

A simple school score calculator/simulator with an embedded language.

There's a live preview: http://alnvdl.github.com/Angst/

Click on "Ajuda" for instructions on how to use. There are some pre-defined formulas on the top right part of the page.

It's outdated, but someone may take interest on extending it to support more complex formulas and improve the usability.

The most interesting part is the compiler for the high-level score formula language, built in JavaScript.
